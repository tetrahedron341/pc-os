# this sure is an OS

What do I want to do here? What is the end goal with this? What wacky
crazy thing will I do to make this stand out?

I dunno. I kinda started this without really having anything in mind.

I should probably plan something soon.

# Ideas:

## Boring linux clone
This would be the safest and easiest plan. Linux is very well documented
and planned out so I wouldn't have to do any thinking at all.

This is boring.

## Microkernels???
i heard about this once and i think it might be a cool idea

## TempleOS
Ring-0 always. No protection. Every process gets full control of memory 
everywhere. This is a very horrible idea but sounds very fun.
